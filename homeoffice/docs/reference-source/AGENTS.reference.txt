# AGENTS.md — working on Friendslop Base

The operating manual for agents and humans changing this repository. It is
self-contained on purpose: `CLAUDE.md` imports it, other tools read it directly.
Keep this file the single source of truth and update it when a contract below
changes.

## 1. What this is

A browser multiplayer starter: a shared building for 2–8 players — common room,
hall, mezzanine, workshop, back room and an outdoor yard behind sliding doors —
with physical props you can pick up and throw, bouncy balls, guns and bats that
shove whoever they hit, a pickup horn, and proximity voice that sounds like it
comes from the other player's mouth. Nobody has health and nobody dies. No objectives, scores, roles
or accounts — the game built on top of it decides those.

**One repository, at most one process, one public port.** Deployed on Node,
that port serves the compiled client, `GET /healthz`, the game + WebRTC-signaling
WebSocket at `/ws`, and the Opus fallback voice WebSocket at `/voice`. Deployed
as static files, there is no process of ours at all: the room creator's browser
runs the same authority in a worker and peers reach it over WebRTC, with a
PeerJS broker only for the handshake. There is no database, TURN server, media
server, account system or second dev server. Rooms live in memory and end when
the process — or the host's tab — does.

The client picks a mode at boot by probing `/healthz`; `?net=server` and
`?net=p2p` force one. See §12.

Stack: TypeScript throughout. Three.js and Rapier (WASM) in the browser, Rapier
again on the server, `ws`, Vite for the client, Playwright + real Chrome for
browser tests, Blender's Python API for the original character. Node ≥ 22.20.

## 3. How it works (the model to keep in your head)

**Authority.** One `Simulation` owns truth: positions, velocities, who holds
what. Clients send *inputs*, never positions. The same `Simulation` class runs
in each browser as a prediction world (`new Simulation(true)`).

Where the authority *runs* is a deployment property, not a code path. `createHost`
in `src/host/index.ts` speaks only the `Channel` interface, so it runs in Node
behind `ws` or in a browser worker behind WebRTC DataChannels. A browser host is
also a player: it joins its own authority through `linkedChannels()` and keeps
the full prediction and reconciliation path, so there is exactly one client
code path and the host is not a special case.

**Clocks.** Server ticks physics at 60 Hz (`STEP`), consuming at most one input
per player per tick. Clients batch two inputs every 1/30 s. Snapshots go out at
20 Hz (`tick % 3 === 0`); a full keyframe every 2 s, deltas against the
client's acknowledged baseline otherwise. A client that has lost its baseline
sends `0` and gets a full one.

**Prediction.** The client keeps unacknowledged inputs, applies each snapshot by
`restore()`-ing its own state then replaying the unacked inputs, and blends the
resulting camera correction. Remote players render from a 100 ms interpolation
buffer (position, yaw, pitch). Props are dynamic Rapier bodies on the server and
kinematic proxies on the client, except the one you hold, which is predicted.

**Rooms.** Six-character codes from `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`. Player
ids start at 1, never reused within a room, error past 65000. A dropped socket
neutralises inputs, drops the held prop, and reserves the slot for 30 s under a
reconnect token; an empty room is disposed after 30 s. `MAX_ROOMS` (default 16)
caps room creation. Client-side preview avatars use ids ≥ 60000 — that range
is never a real player.

**Actions.** `pickup` / `drop` / `throw` / `shoot` / `door` are JSON messages with
a client request id (deduplicated server-side). `pickup` succeeds only if
`Simulation.target()` — a 2.8 m ray from the player's eye along their look
direction — hits exactly that object and nobody owns it. Aim matters: floor
props need pitch downward.

**Props have kinds.** `PROPS` in `level.ts` pairs each start position with
`crate`, `ball`, `gun`, `bat` or `horn`; the id is still the index + 1. The kind picks the
collider (a ball is a bouncy sphere with `CoefficientCombineRule.Max`), the mesh,
and how it is carried. Kinds are static and never travel on the wire.

**Shooting.** A gun fires with left click or `F`, on a `WEAPON.cooldown` tick
timer the server owns. The authority casts the ray, and a hit adds
`WEAPON.knock`/`WEAPON.lift` to the victim's velocity plus `WEAPON.stagger` ticks
of lost footing, which is a networked `PlayerState` field so the client's replay
agrees. There is no health, no death and no respawn: you get pushed. The
accepted shot is broadcast for tracers and sound; the shooter draws its own
tracer immediately and ignores the echo.

**Doors.** `DOORS` in `level.ts` lists sliding leaves that live in the physics
world as kinematic bodies. Hand-worked leaves toggle with `E` when the crosshair
is on them; leaves marked `auto` open for anyone within `AUTO_RANGE`. Both sides
animate over `DOOR_TRAVEL` seconds. The authority is the source of truth and
broadcasts every change; a client ORs that with its own proximity so an
automatic leaf never flickers.

**Voice.** Two transports through one spatial emitter per peer: native WebRTC
(STUN only, lower id offers) and a server relay of raw 20 ms Opus frames over
`/voice`. A per-pair state machine (see `docs/voice.md`) falls back to relay
after 3 s, probes direct again with backoff, and upgrades only when both ends
confirm. The voice socket authenticates with a per-connection ticket issued
over `/ws`. The server stamps the sender id on every relayed frame.

**Avatars.** One GLB, cloned per player with `SkeletonUtils.clone`; the material
named `Jacket / tintable` is recoloured from `PALETTE[(id-1) % 8]`. Clips
`Idle/Walk/Sprint/Crouch/Jump` are chosen from flags and speed. Four bones are
aimed by the runtime rather than by clips: `head` from networked look pitch,
`jaw` from voice loudness (mouth opens like a lid), `armL`/`armR` when `held`.
Section 7 explains exactly how, because it is easy to get wrong.

Wire tables, byte layouts and limits: `docs/architecture.md`. Do not restate
them here; change them there when you change `protocol.ts`.

## 4. Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run dev                          # http://localhost:3000 — one port, client HMR
npm run typecheck                    # tsc --noEmit over src, tools, tests, configs
npm test                             # tests/*.test.ts        (protocol, physics, Opus, acoustics)
npm run test:server                  # tests/server/*.test.ts (rooms, auth, routing)
npm run test:browser                 # Playwright, installed Chrome, synthetic microphone
npm run build && npm start           # production: dist/client + dist/server, PORT (3000)
npm run build:client                 # static deploys: dist/client only, no server compile
PRODUCTION=1 npm run test:browser    # smoke-test the build on :3001
npm run bots                         # 8 headless clients for 30 s (ROOM_CODE, BOTS, SECONDS, SERVER_URL)
npm run broker                       # PeerJS signalling broker on :3010 (BROKER_PORT); npm run dev starts one already
npm run assets                       # python3 tools/generate-ir.py && blender ... generate-assets.py
```

Only `blender` is not an npm dependency. `npm run assets` expects it on `PATH`;
on macOS call `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender --background
--factory-startup --python tools/generate-assets.py` directly. Blender 5.2 is
the tested version (`BLENDER_EEVEE`, not `BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT`).

There is no linter or formatter config. `npm run typecheck` is the gate; code
is prettier-default shaped (2 spaces, double quotes, semicolons, trailing
commas, ~80 columns). The Python tools are intentionally dense — match the file
you are in.

## 5. The fast loop: connect, change, see it

1. **Is a server already up?** `curl -s localhost:3000/healthz` → `{"ok":true}`
   means someone (often the user) is running `npm run dev`. Use it; do not start
   a second one on another port unless you need isolation.
2. **Edit.** Client files (`src/client/**`, `style.css`) hot-reload in place.
   Editing `src/server/**` or `src/shared/**` restarts the application systems
   inside the same process and **resets every room** — everyone gets kicked to
   the lobby and must rejoin. Expect this; it is not a crash.
3. **Get in.** Open `http://localhost:3000/?test=1&name=Dev`, click *Create a
   room*, read the code from `#room-code`. Query switches:
   `?room=CODE` prefills the code, `?name=` the name, `?fresh=1` forgets the
   saved reconnect token, `?wasm=1` forces the WASM Opus encoder, `?test=1`
   (DEV builds only) lets key events reach the input set without pointer lock.
4. **Drive it.** After `welcome`, DEV builds expose `window.__friendslop`:

   ```ts
   state      // your predicted PlayerState (x, y, z, yaw, pitch, flags, held, …)
   members    // [{ id, name, connected, voiceReady }]
   scene      // GameScene — avatars Map, props Map, camera, renderer
   sim        // your prediction Simulation
   voice      // Voice — peers Map, status, codec, loudness(id), force(id, relay)
   input(code, down)   // e.g. input("KeyW", true) — bypasses pointer lock
   look(yaw, pitch)    // set the camera/look angles directly
   action(throwing?)   // pick up / drop / throw whatever target() hits
   join(code), send(json)
   ```

   Useful reads: `scene.avatars.get(id).root.position`, `.mouth`, `.current`
   (clip name), `.head.bone.matrixWorld`. Look direction math: forward is
   `(-sin yaw · cos pitch, -sin pitch, -cos yaw · cos pitch)`; to face a point,
   `yaw = atan2(-(dx), -(dz))`, positive pitch looks **down**.
5. **Get a second player.** Never rely on a second browser tab you are not
   looking at: background tabs throttle `requestAnimationFrame`, so that
   player's inputs stall and remote avatars appear frozen or never appear. Use
   a headless client instead — section 8.
6. **Gate before you claim done.**
   `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run test:server && npm run test:browser`.
   The browser suite reuses a running `:3000` server and needs installed Chrome.
   Report failures verbatim; do not paraphrase them away.

## 6. Where a change goes

| You want to… | Touch | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Change the room's geometry | `src/shared/level.ts` `LEVEL` | Boxes are both mesh and collider. Metres, Y up. Decorative extras live in `GameScene` constructor. |
| Move spawns / props | `SPAWNS`, `PROPS` in `level.ts` | Eight spawns; prop ids are index + 1. Give a prop a kind: `crate`, `ball` or `gun`. |
| Add a prop kind | `PROPS`/`PropKind` in `level.ts`, `shape()` in `simulation.ts`, `makeProp()` in `scene.ts` | Keep children[0] of the mesh group the tintable body — `setHighlight` writes its emissive. |
| Add or move a door | `DOORS` in `level.ts` | Leaves slide from `p` to `p + slide`; mount them in front of the wall they cover. `auto` makes them open on approach. |
| Tune the guns | `WEAPON` in `level.ts` | Range, cooldown, shove, lift, recoil, stagger length and how much steering a staggered player keeps. |
| Tune movement | `Simulation.motor()` | Runs identically on both sides. Gravity is set in the Rapier world **and** the motor's vertical acceleration — change both. |
| Add a player action | `app.ts` `msg.type === "action"` → validate with server state → mutate `Simulation`; client trigger in `main.ts`; visual in `scene.ts` | Clients never decide ownership or authoritative position. Dedupe by `request`. |
| Add replicated state | `protocol.ts` writer **and** reader, `PlayerState`/`PropState`, tests in `core.test.ts`, tables in `docs/architecture.md` | Bump `VERSION` for incompatible layouts. Keep membership/control out of the tick. Respect the fixed record sizes and ±327.67 m prop range. |
| Change how remote players look or animate | `scene.ts` `avatar()`, `updatePlayer()`, `render()` | Runtime-owned bones: section 7. |
| Change the character mesh or rig | `tools/generate-assets.py` → regenerate → commit `.glb` **and** `.blend` | Keep the clip names, `Jacket / tintable`, and the bone names, or update `scene.ts` with them. |
| Change voice range / acoustics | `VOICE` in `level.ts`; `REVERB_REGIONS` in `acoustics.ts`; graph in `spatial.ts`; IRs via `tools/generate-ir.py` | Regions are axis-aligned boxes that blend across `blendWidth`. |
| Change voice transport behaviour | `voice.ts` state machine, `app.ts` `pair()/route()/route-request` | Both endpoints must confirm before an upgrade. Read `docs/voice.md` first. |
| Change UI copy, HUD, drawers | The template string at the top of `main.ts`; `style.css` | Ids like `#room-code`, `#hud`, `#loading`, button names are used by the Playwright tests — keep them or update the tests. |
| Change branding | `public/favicon.svg`, the inline SVG in the `.brand` button, `.brand-*` rules | The mark's paths are duplicated deliberately (favicon vs inline); change both. |

## 7. Avatar bone contract (read before touching `scene.ts` or the Blender script)

Rig: `hips → spine → head → jaw`, `spine → armL/armR`, `hips → legL/legR`.
Rigid weights, one bone per vertex. The head is a sphere bisected at the mouth
line: `Jawbowl` (lower, on `head`) and `Cranium` (upper, on `jaw`, hinged at the
back of the skull so it lifts like a lid). Cap and eyes ride `jaw`.

Coordinate facts: Blender is Z-up and the model faces −Y; glTF/three is Y-up and
the model faces +Z. The avatar root gets `rotation.y = yaw + π`, sits at
`s.y − 0.85` (−0.5 crouched, with `scale.y = 0.63`), the camera at `s.y + 0.65`,
the name label at `+1.95`.

Rules the code depends on:

- **Bone names contain no `.`.** The glTF exporter strips dots (`arm.L` became
  `armL`), which silently broke `getObjectByName("arm.L")` for a long time.
- **`head` and `jaw` are never keyframed** in the Blender actions. The exporter
  still bakes constant tracks for them, which is why the next rule exists.
- **Never assign `bone.rotation.x` to aim a bone.** The rest quaternions are not
  identity; a Euler write composes against a stale decomposition and swings the
  limb the wrong way. Use `hinge()` — a quaternion multiply about the bone's
  local X.
- **Never compound an offset onto the live quaternion.** Three.js
  `PropertyMixer` skips writing a track whose value did not change since the
  last frame, so a bone you aimed will *not* be reset by the mixer. `repose()`
  puts each driven bone's last mixer pose back, runs `mixer.update()`, then
  records the new pose; every offset is rebuilt from that recorded pose.
  Symptom of breaking this: heads and arms rotate endlessly.
- The client never plays the `Hold` clip; the held pose is the runtime hinge on
  the arms (`HOLD_LIFT = -1.1` rad ≈ arms forward). Head tilt is `pitch × 0.55`
  clamped to ±1.2 rad of pitch; mouth is `0..1 × 0.5` rad.
- In `generate-assets.py`, bmesh operators work in **object-local** space
  (`plane_co = JAW_LINE − HEAD[2]`, not the world height).

Regenerate with the Blender command in section 4, then check the result in
Blender renders or in-game before committing. `.blend1` backups are ignored.

## 8. A controllable second player

Fastest, zero code: `ROOM_CODE=<code> BOTS=1 SECONDS=600 npm run bots` joins a
bot that walks in a slow circle. It never talks or picks things up.

For pitch, speaking and actions, write a throwaway script on this pattern,
which is what `tools/bots.ts` does. Keep it outside the repo and run it as
`NODE_PATH=$PWD/node_modules npx tsx /path/to/bot.ts` so `ws` still resolves;
import `protocol.ts` by absolute path.

```ts
import { WebSocket } from "ws";
import { encodeInputs } from "/abs/path/to/friendslop-base/src/shared/protocol.ts";
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000/ws");               // leave binaryType alone:
let seq = 0, baseline = 0;                                        // raw arrives as a Buffer
ws.on("open", () => ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "join", name: "Bot", code: "ABC234" })));
ws.on("message", (raw, binary) => {
  if (binary) return;                                             // snapshots; decodeSnapshot(Uint8Array.from(raw).buffer) if needed
  const m = JSON.parse(raw.toString());
  if (m.type !== "welcome") return;
  setInterval(() => {                                             // two inputs every 1/30 s, like the client
    const inputs = [1, 2].map(() => ({ seq: ++seq, x: 0, z: 0, yaw: 0, pitch: -1.0, buttons: 0 }));
    ws.send(encodeInputs(inputs, baseline));
  }, 1000 / 30);
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "speaking", active: true }));    // drives the mouth-babble fallback
  // ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "action", request: 1, action: "pickup", object: 4 }));
});
```

`x`/`z` in `[-1, 1]` are strafe/forward relative to `yaw`; `buttons` is
`JUMP=1 | SPRINT=2 | CROUCH=4`. A pickup is only accepted when the eye ray hits
the object — compute yaw and pitch toward the prop's actual position, which you
can read from a browser client's `scene.props.get(id).position`.

Without a WebRTC peer, `Voice.loudness(id)` returns −1 and the avatar falls
back to procedural babble while the `speaking` flag is on; with a real peer the
mouth follows measured RMS. Playwright's fake microphone (`tests/voice-fixture.wav`)
exercises the real path.

## 9. Rules that are not negotiable

- Server authority: no client-sent position, ownership, or peer id is trusted.
  The server stamps voice frame sources and validates every action. Shots are
  decided by the authority's ray, not by a client claiming a hit, and a door
  only moves for a player actually looking at it.
- Nobody dies. A hit is a shove and a stagger; players are never removed,
  respawned or scored by this layer.
- `src/shared` stays isomorphic. `src/client` never imports `src/server`;
  `src/server` never imports three or Web Audio.
- Physics never travels as JSON. Bounded everything: input queues (12), inputs
  per packet (8), voice frame size (1500 B), send buffers, action dedupe history.
- At most one process of ours, one port. Do not add a second server, a
  database, a TURN server, or assume multiple replicas can share rooms. The
  PeerJS broker is a handshake rendezvous, not somewhere state may live.
- Protocol changes update writer, reader, tests and `docs/architecture.md`
  together, and bump `VERSION` when incompatible.
- Generated artefacts (`.glb`, `.blend`, `.wav`) are committed **with** the
  script change that produced them.
- Playwright selectors are part of the UI contract (`#loading`, `#hud`,
  `#room-code`, `#player-count`, `#peer-debug`, button names *Create a room*,
  *Join →*, *Enable voice*, *Diagnostics*, *Force relay*, *Allow P2P*).

## 10. Known sharp edges

- Background browser tabs throttle rAF (section 5). Symptom: a remote avatar
  never appears or is frozen. It is the tab, not the server.
- **A browser host in a background tab is the biggest unknown in p2p mode.** The
  authority runs in a worker specifically so a hidden tab keeps ticking, and the
  accumulator caps catch-up at 5 steps so a stall is a hitch rather than a
  spiral. This has *not* been measured: the throttling spike was cancelled. If
  a p2p room freezes when the host switches tabs, that is the first suspect.
  Playwright cannot catch it — the config passes
  `--disable-background-timer-throttling` and `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`.
- Two `npm run dev` processes at once will make the browser suite fail in
  confusing, avatar-shaped ways. Check `pgrep -f tools/dev.ts` before believing
  a failure. Playwright's `reuseExistingServer` does not clean up orphans.
- peerjs maps `reliable: false` onto `ordered: false` only; the DataChannel still
  retransmits. There is no way through peerjs 1.5 to get `maxRetransmits: 0`.
- Editing `src/server` or `src/shared` under a running dev server resets rooms
  mid-test. Rejoin; don't debug the "disconnect".
- After `welcome`, remote avatars only appear once a snapshot containing them
  is interpolated; give it a second before concluding something is broken.
- `WebGLRenderer.render` is an own property in three r180. Deleting or
  reassigning it during manual poking kills the frame loop silently — the last
  frame stays on screen and everything looks frozen. Read state through
  `__friendslop`; don't monkey-patch the renderer.
- `Simulation.pickup()` fails when the eye ray misses even by a little. Props
  rest at `y ≈ 0.3`, not their spawn `0.5`.
- Vite's preview of `file://` pages cannot be scripted from some agent browsers;
  serve scratch HTML over HTTP if you need to inspect it.
- `voice.monitor()` runs every 500 ms; `Voice.loudness()` is the per-frame
  path. Don't add per-frame work to `monitor()`.
- `initPhysics()` must resolve before `new Simulation()` on either side.

## 11. Deploying

`npm run build` → `dist/client` + `dist/server`; `npm start` runs
`node dist/server/server/index.js` on `PORT`. The Dockerfile is a two-stage
build with a health check on `/healthz`; `render.yaml` is a one-service
blueprint. TLS can terminate in Node with `TLS_CERT`/`TLS_KEY`. Remote voice
needs HTTPS (LAN HTTP does not get the microphone exception). Deploys reset
rooms; there is no cross-instance room routing. Details: `docs/deployment.md`.
The GitHub Pages workflow publishes `dist/client` in browser-hosted P2P mode and
uses GitHub's reported base path so repository subpaths work.

## 12. The two deployment modes

The same client bundle runs both. `detect()` in `src/net/mode.ts` probes
`/healthz` at boot: JSON with `ok: true` means a Node authority is present,
anything else (404, or a CDN's SPA fallback serving `index.html`) means browser
hosting. `?net=server` and `?net=p2p` force a mode, which is how both are
exercised against one `npm run dev`.

| | server mode | p2p mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authority | Node, `src/server/app.ts` adapter | host's browser, `src/host/worker.ts` |
| Game transport | WebSocket `/ws` | PeerJS DataChannel, reliable ordered |
| Voice relay transport | WebSocket `/voice` | PeerJS DataChannel, unordered |
| Peer↔peer voice | unchanged — WebRTC mesh, signalling relayed by the authority |
| Room code | authority generates | claimed with the broker, then `ensureRoom()` |
| Who can join | everyone | direct-connectable peers, plus TURN if configured |

`iceServers` and `broker` come from `/healthz` in server mode and from
`public/config.json` in p2p mode, both falling back to Google STUN and the
public PeerJS broker.

Rules that are easy to break here:

- **The host is not a special case.** It joins its own authority over
  `linkedChannels()` and keeps prediction and reconciliation. Do not shortcut it
  to read the authoritative `Simulation` directly; that creates bugs only the
  host can reproduce.
- **`src/host` and `src/net` must stay free of `node:*`, `ws`, three and the
  DOM.** `src/net/ws-node.ts`, `ws-client.ts` and `peer.ts` are the adapters
  where those are allowed. `tools/dev.ts` watches `host` and `net` as well as
  `server` and `shared`, so editing any of them resets rooms.
- **Backpressure crosses the worker boundary on a timer.** The worker cannot see
  a DataChannel's queue, so `worker-bridge.ts` posts `bufferedAmount` every
  100 ms. A host that starts dropping snapshots under load is looking at values
  up to 100 ms stale.
- **Never `close({ flush: true })` a peerjs connection.** In `raw` serialization
  the close marker is an object the DataChannel cannot send.
